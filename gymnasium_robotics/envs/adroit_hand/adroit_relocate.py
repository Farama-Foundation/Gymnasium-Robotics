    ## Description

    This environment was introduced in ["Learning Complex Dexterous Manipulation with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Demonstrations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10087)
    by Aravind Rajeswaran, Vikash Kumar, Abhishek Gupta, Giulia Vezzani, John Schulman, Emanuel Todorov, and Sergey Levine.

    The environment is based on the [Adroit manipulation platform](https://github.com/vikashplus/Adroit), a30 degree of freedom system which consists of a 24 degrees of freedom
    ShadowHand and a 6 degree of freedom arm. The task to be completed consists on moving the blue ball to the green target. The positions of the ball and target are randomized over the entire
    workspace. The task will be considered successful when the object is within epsilon-ball of the target.

    ## Action Space

    The action space is a `Box(-1.0, 1.0, (30,), float32)`. The control actions are absolute angular positions of the Adroit hand joints. The input of the control actions is set to a range between -1 and 1 by scaling the real actuator angle ranges in radians.
    The elements of the action array are the following:

    | Num | Action                                                                                  | Control Min | Control Max | Angle Min    | Angle Max   | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit        |

    ## Observation Space

    The observation space is of the type `Box(-inf, inf, (39,), float64)`. It contains information about the angular position of the finger joints, the pose of the palm of the hand, as well as kinematic information about the ball and target.

    ## Rewards

    The environment can be initialized in either a `dense` or `sparse` reward variant.

    In the `dense` reward setting, the environment returns a `dense` reward function that consists of the following parts:
    - `get_to_ball`: increasing negative reward the further away the palm of the hand is from the ball. This is computed as the 3 dimensional Euclidean distance between both body frames.
        This penalty is scaled by a factor of `0.1` in the final reward.
    - `ball_off_table`: add a positive reward of 1 if the ball is lifted from the table (`z` greater than `0.04` meters). If this condition is met two additional rewards are added:
        - `make_hand_go_to_target`: negative reward equal to the 3 dimensional Euclidean distance from the palm to the target ball position. This reward is scaled by a factor of `0.5`.
        -` make_ball_go_to_target`: negative reward equal to the 3 dimensional Euclidean distance from the ball to its target position. This reward is also scaled by a factor of `0.5`.
    - `ball_close_to_target`: bonus of `10` if the ball's Euclidean distance to its target is less than `0.1` meters. Bonus of `20` if the distance is less than `0.05` meters.

    The `sparse` reward variant of the environment can be initialized by calling `gym.make('AdroitHandReloateSparse-v1')`.
    In this variant, the environment returns a reward of 10 for environment success and -0.1 otherwise.

    ## Starting State

    The ball is set randomly over the table at reset. The ranges of the uniform distribution from which the position is samples are `[-0.15,0.15]` for the `x` coordinate, and `[-0.15,0.3]` got the `y` coordinate.
    The target position is also sampled from uniform distributions with ranges `[-0.2,0.2]` for the `x` coordinate, `[-0.2,0.2]` for the `y` coordinate, and `[0.15,0.35]` for the `z` coordinate.

    The joint values of the environment are deterministically initialized to a zero.

    For reproducibility, the starting state of the environment can also be set when calling `env.reset()` by passing the `options` dictionary argument (https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env.reset)
    with the `initial_state_dict` key. The `initial_state_dict` key must be a dictionary with the following items:

    * `qpos`: np.ndarray with shape `(36,)`, MuJoCo simulation joint positions
    * `qvel`: np.ndarray with shape `(36,)`, MuJoCo simulation joint velocities
    * `obj_pos`: np.ndarray with shape `(3,)`, cartesian coordinates of the ball object
    * `target_pos`: np.ndarray with shape `(3,)`, cartesian coordinates of the goal ball location

    The state of the simulation can also be set at any step with the `env.set_env_state(initial_state_dict)` method.

    ## Episode End

    The episode will be `truncated` when the duration reaches a total of `max_episode_steps` which by default is set to 200 timesteps.
    The episode is never `terminated` since the task is continuing with infinite horizon.

    ## Arguments

    To increase/decrease the maximum number of timesteps before the episode is `truncated` the `max_episode_steps` argument can be set at initialization. The default value is 50. For example, to increase the total number of timesteps to 400 make the environment as follows:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym

    env = gym.make('AdroitHandRelocate-v1', max_episode_steps=400)
    ```

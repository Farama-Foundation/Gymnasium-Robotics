    ## Description

    This environment was introduced in ["Learning Complex Dexterous Manipulation with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Demonstrations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10087)
    by Aravind Rajeswaran, Vikash Kumar, Abhishek Gupta, Giulia Vezzani, John Schulman, Emanuel Todorov, and Sergey Levine.

    The environment is based on the [Adroit manipulation platform](https://github.com/vikashplus/Adroit), a 28 degree of freedom system which consists of a 24 degrees of freedom
    ShadowHand and a 4 degree of freedom arm. The task to be completed consists on picking up a hammer with and drive a nail into a board. The nail position is randomized and has
    dry friction capable of absorbing up to 15N force. Task is successful when the entire length of the nail is inside the board.

    ## Action Space

    The action space is a `Box(-1.0, 1.0, (26,), float32)`. The control actions are absolute angular positions of the Adroit hand joints. The input of the control actions is set to a range between -1 and 1 by scaling the real actuator angle ranges in radians.
    The elements of the action array are the following:

    The observation space is of the type `Box(-inf, inf, (46,), float64)`. It contains information about the angular position of the finger joints, the pose of the palm of the hand, the pose of the hammer and nail, and external forces on the nail.

    ## Rewards

    The environment can be initialized in either a `dense` or `sparse` reward variant.

    In the `dense` reward setting, the environment returns a `dense` reward function that consists of the following parts:
    - `get_to_hammer`: increasing negative reward the further away the palm of the hand is from the hammer. This is computed as the 3 dimensional Euclidean distance between both body frames.
        This penalty is scaled by a factor of `0.1` in the final reward.
    - `take_hammer_head_to_nail`: increasing negative reward the further away the head of the hammer if from the head of the nail. This reward is also computed as the 3 dimensional Euclidean
        distance between both body frames
    - `make_nail_go_inside`: negative cost equal to the 3 dimensional Euclidean distance from the head of the nail to the board.
        This penalty is scaled by a factor of `10` in the final reward.
    - `velocity_penalty`: Minor velocity penalty for the full dynamics of the environments. Used to bound the velocity of the bodies in the environment.
        It equals the norm of all the joint velocities. This penalty is scaled by a factor of `0.01` in the final reward.
    - `lift_hammer`: adds a positive reward of `2` if the hammer is lifted a greater distance than `0.04` meters in the z direction.
    - `hammer_nail`: adds a positive reward the closer the head of the nail is to the board. `25` if the distance is less than `0.02` meters and `75` if it is less than `0.01` meters.

    The `sparse` reward variant of the environment can be initialized by calling `gym.make('AdroitHandHammerSparse-v1')`.
    In this variant, the environment returns a reward of 10 for environment success and -0.1 otherwise.

    ## Starting State

    To add stochasticity to the environment the z position of the board with the nail is randomly initialized each time the environment is reset. This height is sampled from
    a uninform distribution with range `[0.1,0.25]`.

    The joint values of the environment are deterministically initialized to a zero.

    For reproducibility, the starting state of the environment can also be set when calling `env.reset()` by passing the `options` dictionary argument (https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/#gymnasium.Env.reset)
    with the `initial_state_dict` key. The `initial_state_dict` key must be a dictionary with the following items:

    * `qpos`: np.ndarray with shape `(33,)`, MuJoCo simulation joint positions
    * `qvel`: np.ndarray with shape `(33,)`, MuJoCo simulation joint velocities
    * `board_pos`: np.ndarray with shape `(3,)`, cartesian coordinates of the board with the nail

    The state of the simulation can also be set at any step with the `env.set_env_state(initial_state_dict)` method.

    ## Episode End

    The episode will be `truncated` when the duration reaches a total of `max_episode_steps` which by default is set to 200 timesteps.
    The episode is never `terminated` since the task is continuing with infinite horizon.

    ## Arguments

    To increase/decrease the maximum number of timesteps before the episode is `truncated` the `max_episode_steps` argument can be set at initialization. The default value is 50. For example, to increase the total number of timesteps to 400 make the environment as follows:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym

    env = gym.make('AdroitHandHammer-v1', max_episode_steps=400)
    ```

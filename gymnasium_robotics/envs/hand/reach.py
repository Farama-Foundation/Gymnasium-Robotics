    ### Description

    This environment was introduced in ["Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning: Challenging Robotics Environments and Request for Research"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09464).

    The environment is based on the [Shadow Dexterous Hand](https://www.shadowrobot.com/), which is an antropomorphic robotic hand with 24 joints. The goal of the task is for the fingertips of the hand to reach a predefined target Cartesian position.
    The hand has a total of 20 motor controlled degrees of freedom out of the 24 joints. The thumb has 5 joints and 5 DoF while the rest of the fingers have 4 joints and 3 DoF (each finger's distal joint is coupled with a tendon to its middle joint
    just like a human hand, so that the middle joint angle is always greater or equal to the distal joint angle). The control frequency of the actuators is of `f = 25 Hz`. This is achieved by applying the same action in 20 subsequent simulator step
    (with a time step of `dt = 0.002 s`) before returning the control to the robot.

    The kinematics of the Shadow Dexterous Hand resembles that of the human hand. The robot hand has 2 degrees of freedom for the wrist to perform the radial/lunar deviation movements (`WRJ1`) and flexion/extension (`WRJ0`). Each finger has three joints
    in common. The joint closer to the palm is called *metacarpophalangeal* (MCP) and has a total of 2 degrees of freedom each. In  the robot they are defined as `FFJ3`, `MFJ3`, `RFJ3`, `LFJ3`, and `THJ2` (forefinger, middle finger, ring finger, little
    finger, and thumb respectively) for the adduction/abduction degree of freedom, and `FFJ2`, `MFJ2`, `RFJ2`, `LFJ2`, `THJ1` for the flexion/extension DoF. The middle joint in the fingers is known as *proximal interphalangea* (PIP), which in the robot hand
    correspond to `FFJ1`, `MFJ1`, `RFJ1`, and `LFJ1`. This joint is also responsible for flexion/extension. The last joint in common is the most distant to the palm, called *distal interphalangeal* (DIP) and in the robot hand `FFJ0`, `MFJ0`, `RFJ0`, and `LFJ0`.
    This joint is not actuated but coupled to the PIP joints by tendons in MuJoCo.

    In the robot hand an extra joint is added to the little finger `LFJ4` in order to perform the opposition movement with the thumb. Also the the human thumb has two different joints than the rest of the fingers. The *carpometacarpal* (CMC) joint located close
    to the palm area, `THJ4` and `THJ3`in the robot. And the *interphalangeal* joint which is in the same location as the DIP but in this case actuated. This joint is the `THJ0` in the robot hand.

    ### Action Space

    The action space is a `Box(-1.0, 1.0, (20,), float32)`. The control actions are absolute angular positions of the actuated joints (non-coupled). The input of the control actions is set to a range between -1 and 1 by scaling the actual actuator angle ranges.
    The elements of the action array are the following:

    ### Observation Space

    The observation is a `goal-aware observation space`. It consists of a dictionary with information about the robot's joint and finger states, as well as information about the goal. The finger tip observations are derived from
    Mujoco bodies known as [sites](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html?highlight=site#body-site) attached to the body of interest such as the finger tips. The dictionary consists of the following 3 keys:

    - `observation`: its value is an `ndarray` of shape `(63,)`. It consists of kinematic information of the block object and gripper. The elements of the array correspond to the following:

        | Num | Observation                                                       | Min    | Max    | Joint Name (in corresponding XML file) | Site Name (in corresponding XML file) |Joint Type| Unit                     |

    - `achieved_goal`: this key represents the current state of the fingers, as if it would have achieved a goal. This is useful for goal orientated learning algorithms such as those that use [Hindsight Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495) (HER).
    The value is an `ndarray` with shape `(15,)`. The elements of the array are the following:

    ### Rewards
    The reward can be initialized as `sparse` or `dense`:
    - *sparse*: the returned reward can have two values: `-1` if the fingers haven't reached their final target position, and `0` if the fingers are in their final target position (the fingers are considered to have reached their goal if the 2-nom between
    the achieved goal vector and the desired goal vector is lower than 0.01).
    - *dense*: the returned reward is the negative 2-norm distance between the achieved goal vector and the desired goal vector.

    To initialize this environment with one of the mentioned reward functions the type of reward must be specified in the id string when the environment is initialized. For `sparse` reward the id is the default of the environment, `HandReach-v1`.
    However, for `dense` reward the id must be modified to `HandReachDense-v1` and initialized as follows:

    ```
    import gymnasium as gym

    env = gym.make('HandReachDense-v1')
    ```

    ### Starting State

    When the environment is reset the joints of the hand are initialized with the following angles (rad):

    For the target cartersian position of the fingers there are two possible initializations chosen randomly. With a probability of 10 % the episodes goal will be to keep the initial position of the finger tips for an indefinete perido of time.
    The initial position of the finger tips will then be:

    | Finger Tip | Coordinate | Position (m) |
    | ---------  | ---------  | -------------- |
    | Forefinger | x          | 0.99           |
    | Forefinger | y          | 0.8            |
    | Forefinger | z          | 0.15           |
    | Middle     | x          | 1.02           |
    | Middle     | y          | 0.8            |
    | Middle     | z          | 0.15           |
    | Ring       | x          | 1.04           |
    | Ring       | y          | 0.81           |
    | Ring       | z          | 0.155          |
    | Little     | x          | 1.07           |
    | Little     | y          | 0.82           |
    | Little     | z          | 0.16           |
    | Thumb      | x          | 0.95           |
    | Thumb      | y          | 0.84           |
    | Thumb      | z          | 0.16           |

    In the other possible episode intializaitons one of the fingers is randomly selected to meet the tip of the thumb over the palm of the hand. The rest of the finger tips must maintain the initial positions mentioned before.


    ### Episode End

    The episode will be `truncated` when the duration reaches a total of `max_episode_steps` which by default is set to 50 timesteps.
    The episode is never `terminated` since the task is continuing with infinite horizon.

    ### Arguments

    To increase/decrease the maximum number of timesteps before the episode is `truncated` the `max_episode_steps` argument can be set at initialization. The default value is 50. For example,
    to increase the total number of timesteps to 100 make the environment as follows:

    ```
    import gymnasium as gym

    env = gym.make('HandReach-v1', max_episode_steps=100)
    ```

    ### Version History

    * v1: the environment depends on the newest [mujoco python bindings](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html) maintained by the MuJoCo team in Deepmind.
    * v0: the environment depends on `mujoco_py` which is no longer maintained.

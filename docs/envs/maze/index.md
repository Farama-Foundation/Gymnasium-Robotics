# Maze

A collection of environments in which an agent has to navigate through a maze to reach certain goal position. Two different agents can be used: a 2-DoF force-controlled ball, or the classic `Ant` agent from the [Gymnasium MuJoCo environments](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/ant/). The environment can be initialized with a variety of maze shapes with increasing levels of difficulty.

# Franka Kitchen

Multitask environment in which a 9-DoF Franka robot is placed in a kitchen containing several common household items. The goal of each task is to interact with the items in order to reach a desired goal configuration.

    :file: list.html
```

The tasks can be selected when the environment is initialized passing a list of tasks to the `tasks_to_complete` argument as follows:

```python

import gymnasium as gym
import gymnasium_robotics

gym.register_envs(gymnasium_robotics)

env = gym.make('FrankaKitchen-v1', tasks_to_complete=['microwave', 'kettle'])
```

The possible tasks to complete are:

| Task            | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bottom burner` | twist control knob to activate bottom left burner in the stove. |
| `top burner`    | twist control knob to activate top left burner in the stove.    |
| `light switch`  | move a lever switch to turn on a light over the burners.        |
| `slide cabinet` | slide open the cabinet door.                                    |
| `hinge cabinet` | open a hinge cabinet door.                                      |
| `microwave`     | open the microwave door.                                        |
| `kettle`        | move the kettle from the bottom burner to the top burner.       |

# MiniGrid-docs


This repo contains the [NEW website]() for [Gymnasium-robotics](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium-Robotics). This site is currently in Beta and we are in the process of adding/editing information.


The documentation uses Sphinx. However, the documentation is written in regular md, NOT rst.

If you are modifying a non-environment page or an atari environment page, please PR this repo. Otherwise, follow the steps below:

## Instructions for modifying pages

### Editing a page

Fork Gymnasium-Robotics and edit the docstring in the environment's Python file. Then, pip install your fork and run `docs/scripts/gen_mds.py` in this repo. This will automatically generate a md documentation file for the environment.

## Build the Documentation

Install the required packages and Gym (or your fork):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install gym
```

To build the documentation once:

```
cd docs
make dirhtml
```

To rebuild the documentation automatically every time a change is made:

```
cd docs
sphinx-autobuild -b dirhtml ./source build/html
```

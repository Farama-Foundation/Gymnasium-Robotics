This library contains a collection of Reinforcement Learning robotic environments that use the [Gymansium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API. The environments run with the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) physics engine and the maintained [mujoco python bindings](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html).

The creation and interaction with the robotic environments follow the Gymnasium interface:

```{code-block} python

import gymnasium as gym
env = gym.make("FetchPickAndPlace-v2", render_mode="human")
observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)
for _ in range(1000):
   action = policy(observation)  # User-defined policy function
   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

   if terminated or truncated:
      observation, info = env.reset()
env.close()
```

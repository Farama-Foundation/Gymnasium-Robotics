This library contains a collection of Reinforcement Learning robotic environments that use the [Gymansium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) API. The environments run with the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) physics engine and the maintained [mujoco python bindings](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html).
